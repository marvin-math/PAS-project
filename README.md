# Perceptual Awareness Scale experiment
This is a replication of the classical Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS) design used in consciousness research. 
Here, I investigate whether PAS is prone to range effects. The hypothesis is that if participants are shown a narrow and a wide range
of durations of simple geometric shape stimuli, they will adapt their usage of PAS to the given condition. Hence, for one and the same 
stimulus duration, participants will provide different PAS ratings.
